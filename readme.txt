This is the server component of a MediaTeleport, media streaming system with Xbox Smartglass like functionality.
The server simply implements a producer-consumer model to process client requests.

Key features of our project are:
The media is stored on the cloud, along with context like where you last paused etc.
Using gesture controls, you can select the display you want to play the media on, with no prior initial setup required.
